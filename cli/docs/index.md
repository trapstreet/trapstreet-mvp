# trap

**Non-invasive CLI testing framework for AI prompts, agents, and workflows.**

trap treats the program under test (the "solution") as a black box: it invokes it as a subprocess, captures stdout/stderr/files, then optionally pipes the output through a judge (per-case scorer) and a grader (overall aggregator) — also subprocesses, also language-agnostic.

The framework knows nothing about how the solution is implemented. Python, shell scripts, compiled binaries, agentic pipelines — anything invokable from a shell works.

## Core idea: solution and task are decoupled

Two roles, two directories, connected only by a small IO contract:

| Role | Owns | Configures |
|---|---|---|
| **Solution author** | `trap.yaml`, the solution code | how to invoke the solution, which inputs to feed it, which outputs it produces |
| **Task author** | `traptask.yaml`, `judge.py`, `grader.py`, `inputs/`, `expected/` | the test cases, scoring logic, expected outputs |

The solution doesn't need to import trap or know it exists. It reads one environment variable (`TRAP_MANIFEST`, a JSON string with the input directory and the output directory) and runs.

```
TRAP_MANIFEST = {inputs_dir, outputs_dir}   # directory paths
  inputs/{case_id}/  ──────────▶  solution  ──writes──▶  .trap/{task}/{ts}/{case_id}/  (= outputs_dir)

TRAPTASK_MANIFEST = {inputs_dir, expected_dir, outputs_dir}   # directory paths (expected_dir may be null)
  expected/{case_id}/ + the outputs above  ──────────▶  judge  ──▶  {metrics: any JSON}

  all case metrics  ──────────▶  grader  ──▶  {passed, score, ...}
```
